# Trampoline

🚧 Backend Under Development 🚧
This project currently consists of a frontend (this repository) and a separate backend, which is still being developed.

🛠 Frontend and backend are not yet connected. The frontend currently operates without the backend. Backend development is in progress, and integration will happen in a later phase.

**⚠️ NOTE: This project is a work-in-progress and may not always be fully functional. ⚠️**


## Project Overview
This is a personal project where I am learning to develop web applications with React, following the Meta Front-End course. The application is a simple trampoline booking system, originally inspired by the need to keep track of my children's trampoline time to avoid conflicts over whose turn it is. Currently, users can only select a jumper from a hardcoded list, but I plan to further develop and improve the app as I find time between school projects.

Since starting this project, I have also taken a Dynamic Webpage course at school, where I have enhanced my skills in React development.
